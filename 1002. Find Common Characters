'''
Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.

You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
Example 2:

Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]
